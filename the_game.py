n = 5 # number of players
k = 2 # this the rank of the strategic candidate, with 1 being the best

# The employer will choose an l
# The candidate will choose an alpha

# We know for each candidate given an l, whether he prefers to be at alpha = 1 or alpha = n - l

# We can calculate the probability for each l and k and alpha, that of the employer picking the best candidate

# we then find the l that maximises this proability and choose it
